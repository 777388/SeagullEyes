# SeagullEyes
Online Connection Dimension Detection and Constant Connection program

The theory is that if there's a matrix then every rootserver would have differing information on websites due to load balancing of the simulation or alterring of timelines given creation of antimatter and causing backwards time flow variation. Giving us different dimensions of a website where things may or may not be the same as if you were connected to a different root server.

Usage: python3 seagulleyes.py /website/here
