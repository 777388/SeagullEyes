# SeagullEyes
Online Connection Dimension Detection and Constant Connection program

The theory is that if there's a matrix then every rootserver would have differing information on websites due to load balancing of the simulation or alterring of timelines given creation of antimatter and causing backwards time flow variation. Giving us different dimensions of a website where things may or may not be the same as if you were connected to a different root server.

Usage: python3 seagulleyes.py /website/here

requires GAU https://github.com/lc/gau

requires dnsutils, sudo apt install dnsutils, or wsl apt install dnsutils

and if running on Linux (made for windows command line with WSL) remove all instances of wsl in the program



*** NOTE DUE TO RECENT EVENTS & HAS BEEN BANNED FROM CURRENT DIMENSIONS DUE TO IT BEING DNA BACKWARDS, FriedEyes.py ACCOUNTS FOR THIS, WHILE OLD FILES WILL BE LEFT UP. BE SURE TO MANUALLY SEARCH FOR WHAT ROOT SERVER IP ADDRESSES ACTUALLY APPLY TO YOU TO MAXIMIZE PERSONALIZATION.
